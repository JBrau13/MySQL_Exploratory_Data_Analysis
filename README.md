### Project Summary
This is a guided project from Alex the Analyst's YouTube Data Analytics bootcamp series. In this project I analyzed a dataset consisting of layoff data for several large companies beginning in March of 2020 and ending in March of 2023. This included calculating layoff totals
by company and by year as well as looking at how layoff amounts changed over time.
